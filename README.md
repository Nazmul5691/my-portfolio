# 🌐 Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to the official repository of my personal portfolio. This website is a professional showcase designed to highlight my development journey, technical expertise, and the creative projects I have built. It features a "Dark Premium" aesthetic using glass-morphism, vibrant gradients, and technical grid overlays.

## ✨ Design & Feature Highlights

### 💻 Advanced Project Showcase
* **Glass-morphism UI**: Project cards are built with backdrop blur effects for a modern, frosted glass look.
* **Technical Backgrounds**: A signature bottom-left decorative grid with a large square size and a bold white radial glow provides depth.
* **Interactive CTAs**: Custom buttons feature a "Repository" outline style and a "Demo" pink-to-purple gradient style with integrated icons.
* **Smooth Animations**: The UI includes hover transitions like card lifting and image scaling for an engaging user experience.

### 📬 Modern Contact Hub
* **Bold Visual Identity**: A dramatic "Get Ready To Create Great" headline grabs visitor attention immediately.
* **Communication Center**: Dedicated sections with icons for Email, Location, and Phone provide easy access to contact info.
* **High-Conversion Form**: Sleek, dark input fields feature purple focus borders and a primary "Send a message" button in a solid purple finish.

### 🔗 Cohesive Footer
* **Personal Branding**: Minimalist branding features the personalized logo "Meriem</>" with a gradient text effect.
* **Streamlined Navigation**: Quick-access navigation links connect to the Home, About, Skills, Projects, and Contact sections.
* **Copyright Notice**: A professional "All rights reserved" statement includes a dynamic year display.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Framework**: React.js / Vite (for fast and modern development).
* **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (Utility-first approach for pixel-perfect design).
* **Iconography**: Lucide-React (crisp, scalable vector icons).
* **Typography**: Professional use of Bold Italics and clean Sans-serif ensures maximum readability.
